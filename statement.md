Smart Academic Planner and Load Calculator. Project Statement Document.

Problem Statement. Managing assignments, quizzes, exams, and projects throughout school turns out to be a real challenge for many students. Common challenges include tracking deadlines across different subjects. They also involve estimating the time required for each task. Students often struggle with understanding which tasks carry a higher workload. Prioritizing tasks effectively comes up as another issue. Planning a structured study schedule adds to the difficulties.

An incorrect system or no system at all leads to stress for students. It causes last-minute rushes. Productivity ends up being inconsistent as a result.

There is a clear need for a simple, rule-based tool. This tool helps students plan their academics in an efficient way.

Project Scope. The scope of the Smart Academic Planner includes several key elements. User account creation and login form part of it. Creating assignments, quizzes, projects, or exams and so on gets covered too. Storing tasks with JSON handles the data side. Load calculation happens by considering task difficulty. It also factors in estimated hours. Deadline urgency plays a role in that process. Load classification sorts things into low, moderate, high, or overload categories. Generating a daily study plan relies on logical rules.

Exporting tasks as CSV provides one option. Exporting the study plan as PDF offers another. The code stays fully modular in Python.

Target Users. The target audience for this project includes college students. They manage multiple subjects and deadlines all at once. School students work towards tests, assignments, and projects. Learners in coaching institutes plan their study routines with it. Anyone needing a structured academic planning tool can benefit.

It proves particularly useful for students facing high-workload semesters.

High-Level Features. User management handles registrations for users. It deals with login using stored credentials. Separate data keeps things organized for each user.

Task management lets users add tasks with a name. They include the course details. Difficulty level gets specified. Hours required come next. Deadline and priority round out the inputs. Users can view all their tasks. Editing for redundant work stays possible. Deleting tasks works as needed.

The load calculation engine uses rule-based methods. It draws on difficulty ratings. Man-hours consumed factor in heavily. Days remaining influence the outcomes. This classifies tasks into low levels. Moderate comes after that. High and overload follow suit.

The study plan generator creates multi-day plans. It bases them on available hours. Prioritization and urgency help delegate tasks in a smart way. Daily breakdowns of work make it practical.

Generation of reports includes exporting tasks as CSV. Exporting the study plan as PDF works too. Files get stored inside the project directory.
